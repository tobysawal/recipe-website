    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups (681 g) plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 oz (30 g) sugar free vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>2 tsp (8 g) splenda</li>
        <li>13 tbsp (200 g) liquid egg whites ¾ cup + 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>¾ cup (75 g) protein pancake mix</li>
        <li>½ cup (113 g) unsweetened applesauce</li>
        <li>1½ cups (200 g) frozen fruit</li>
        <li>1 cup (64 g) fat free whipped cream</li>
        <li>½ tsp (2 g) splenda</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>For the Crust</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Mix the protein pancake mix and applesauce together until it has combined.</li>
        <li>Spray an 8 inch pie pan or springform pan with oil and add the crust mixture to the dish. Using a spoon, spread the mixture around the bottom of the pan (and up the sides of the dish if using pie pan) in an even layer as best as you can.</li>
        <li>Parbake for 5-10 minutes or until it is no longer wet to the touch while you prepare the filling. The pie pan will likely be ready quicker as it isn't as thick.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, splenda, pudding mix, and egg whites until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Once the crust has parbaked, pour in the filling and smooth out in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Use a waterbath if you don't want it to crack.</li>
        <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature and then place it in the fridge to set for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Thaw out the frozen fruit in the microwave and sprinkle splenda over the top. Mix and allow to macerate for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>This recipe makes 8 servings. Cut the cheesecake into 8 equal slices and top with frozen fruit and 2 tbsp of whipped cream each.</li>
    </ol>
